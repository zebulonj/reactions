# Reactions

Reactive interactions for the DOM.

Status: **Experimental**

## Goal

The goal of this library is to support reactive bindings to DOM events, using a simple, declarative style. The initial focus will be multi-touch interactions. In that context, I will attempt to favor fluidity over distinction between discrete gestures. I will try to recast and abstract DOM events in terms of the goal of user interactions.
